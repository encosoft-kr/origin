# EncoSoft Origin

> Everything has a starting point. This is ours.

This repository functions as the central source of truth for **EncoSoft's internal standards**, including:

* Communication policies
* Branding and naming conventions
* Technical infrastructure decisions
* Repository structuring and naming
* Documentation language and style guides

---

## Structure

All documents are maintained in the **Wiki** for better structure and traceability.

➡️ [View the Wiki](https://github.com/encosoft-kr/origin/wiki)

---

## Why "origin"?

In both naming and philosophy, `origin` represents the **core foundation** of our operation—where intentions are defined, and policies are justified. It is also aligned with our default contact identity:
📫`origin@encosoft.co.kr`

This repository does not contain executable code or data files.
Instead, it defines **how we think, organize, and operate.**
